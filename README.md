#  Pizza Store Sales Insights with-SQL Queries.
**🍕 Pizza Store Sales Insights with SQL Queries**
**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing pizza store sales data using SQL.
I designed a relational database schema and wrote SQL queries to extract valuable business insights such as:

-Best-selling pizzas
-Peak order hours
-Monthly sales trends
-Revenue by category

This project helped me strengthen my SQL, database design, and data analysis skills.

**🗂️ Database Design**
-The database consists of the following tables:
-Orders – stores order details like order_id, date, and time.
-Order Details – connects orders with pizzas ordered.
-Pizzas – contains pizza information such as size and type.
-Pizza Types – categorizes pizzas (Veggie, Classic, Supreme, etc.).
Relationships were implemented with primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity.

**🔍 SQL Queries Covered**
-Basic Queries
-Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
-Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
-Identify the highest-priced pizza.
-Find the most common pizza size ordered.
-List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

**Intermediate Queries**
-Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
-Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
-Category-wise distribution of pizzas.
-Average number of pizzas ordered per day.
-Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

**Advanced Queries**
-Percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
-Cumulative revenue generated over time.
-Top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue in each category.

**📊 Insights Gained**

-Truffle Mushroom Pizza was identified as a premium/highest-priced item.
-Peak order times were successfully analyzed.
-Category-wise and size-wise pizza demand was studied.
-Revenue contribution by different pizzas and categories was highlighted.
